# Responsive Photo Gallery
I've created a responsive photo gallery as a project to practice using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Features
- Displays a collection of photos in a responsive manner across different devices.
- Automatically resizes images to fit the screen size.
- Utilizes React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Employs Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a clean and modern design.
- TypeScript is used to add static typing to the code, increasing robustness and easing maintenance.
